# TRAFFIC LIGH CONTROLLER PROJECT

## Overview

This repository contains the VHDL code and related files for a Traffic Light Controller project developed for the Cyclone V DE1-SoC development board using Quartus. The primary objective of the project is to design a Finite State Machine (FSM) that emulates the functionality of traffic lights and pedestrian crossing lights. The system employs a clock for synchronization and a button for user interaction.

## Features 

- Finite State Machine (FSM) design for traffic and pedestrian lights.
- User Interaction with a button input.
- Hardware Integeration with LEDs for Traffic and Pedestrian light.
- Successful implementation of specified traffic light control logic.


## How To Use

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the Quartus project file in Quartus Prime.
- Compile the project and program the Cyclone V DE1-SoC development board.

## Note

- Ensure proper pin assignments for hardware components on your specific development board.
